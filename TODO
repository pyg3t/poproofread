Change file save system, to utilize a two file system:
file is the file ine
filename.ppr contains the data, that will be reopened the next time
   the work is continued. Possible use json for this.
filename.ppr.out or filename.ppr.exp is the human readable output

Make sure we test if core is active (has a file loaded) before trying
   to save it, e.g. when shutting down the program
