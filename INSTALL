INSTALLATION
------------
This file describes the installation of PoProofRead.

BY PPA
------
If you are on a system that can use ppa's, then the recommended way of
installing PoProofRead is to use the pyg3t-dev-team ppa:
https://launchpad.net/~pyg3t-dev-team/+archive/ppa

MANUAL "INSTALL" FROM BZR CODE DIRECTORY
----------------------------------------

Please note, that this is an ALL user solution. No root access is necessary :)

It is also possible to run PoProofRead directly from a folder with the bzr
checkout and still get of of the functionality like dekstop integration. In
the following it is assumed that the manually checked out code is kept in
/home/username/code. (replace username with your own)

To get the code bzr make sure that you have the bzr command installed and
execute the following commands:
cd ~/code
bzr branch lp:poproofread

Now the poproofread code will live in ~/code/poproofread. In the future the
code can be kept up to date with any new upstream version by executing the
commands:
cd ~/code/poproofread
bzr pull lp:poproofread

### Setting poproofread up for execution from the terminal

Now we must modify the .bashrc file to make sure that the PATH includes the
executable, and the PYTHONPATH to make sure that the python modules can be
imported. Open ~/.bashrc in you favorite editor and add the following lines:
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/code/poproofread/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/code/poproofread

If any of these lines already existed and adds a path to one of these
variables simply add the relevant poproofread path to that line after a ":".

Now the program should be ready to run. Open a new terminal or reload your
.bashrc with:
source ~/.bashrc
and try and run:
poproofread-gtk

### Integrating PoProofRead into the desktop (program and context menus etc.):
To add PoProofRead to the menu system and to the context menus for .podiff,
.podiff.ppr, .txt, .diff and .po files add the .desktop and MIME-type file to
your personal setup:
cp ~/code/poproofread/poproofread_local.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/poproofread.desktop
cp ~/code/poproofread/poproofread.xml ~/.local/share/mime/packages/poproofread.xml

if any of these folders don't exist you will need to create them e.g. with
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/mime/packages

Afterwards edit the ~/.local/share/applications/poproofread.desktop file and
make sure that the paths for Exec, Icon and Path points to the appropriate
locations e.g.:
Exec=/home/username/code/poproofread/bin/poproofread-gtk-local %f
Icon=/home/username/code/poproofread/poproofread/graphics/64.png
Path=/home/username/code/poproofread/poproofread

Afterwards update the relavant databases with the following commands:
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/
update-desktop-database  ~/.local/share/applications/

### Setting poproofread up for execution from GUI programs

Most of the work here has already been done, since poproofread includes a
special executeable (poproofread/bin/poproofread_gtk_local) that are used for
execution from the source code directory.

If you want to be able to open poproofread with a file from the context menus
from one of the programs that looks in the desktop information (e.g. nautilus)
simply follow the directions above.

If you want to do it with a program that allows you to set the executable file
directly, use the file mentioned above with the _local suffix.
