MANUAL INSTALL FROM BZR
-----------------------
It is also possible to run PoProofRead directly from a folder with the bzr checkout. In the following it is assumed that the manually checked out code is kept in /home/username/code. (replace username with your own)

To get the code bzr make sure that you have the bzr command installed and execute the following commands:
cd ~/code
bzr branch lp:poproofread

Now the poproofread code will live in ~/code/poproofread. In the future the code can be kept up to date with any new upstream version by executing the commands:
cd ~/code/poproofread
bzr pull lp:poproofread

Now we must modify the .bashrc file to make sure that the PATH includes the executable, and the PYTHONPATH to make sure that the python modules can be imported. Open ~/.bashrc in you favorite editor and add the following lines:
export PATH=$PATH:/home/username/code/poproofread/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/username/code/poproofread

If any of these lines already existed and adds a path to one of these variables simply add the relavant poproofread path to that line after a ":".

Now the program should be ready to run. Open a new terminal or reload your .bashrc with:
source ~/.bashrc
and try and run:
poproofread-gtk

# Optional and experimental:
To add PoProofRead to the menu system and to the context menus for .podiff and .podiff.ppr files add the .desktop and MIME-type file to your personal setup:
cp ~/code/poproofread/poproofread_local.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/poproofread.desktop
cp ~/code/poproofread/poproofread.xml ~/.local/share/mime/packages/poproofread.xml

Afterwards edit the ~/.local/share/applications/poproofread.desktop file and make sure that the paths for Exec, Icon and Path points to the appropriate locations e.g.:
Exec=/home/username/code/poproofread/poproofread/poproofread_gtk.py %f
Icon=/home/username/code/poproofread/poproofread/graphics/64.png
Path=/home/username/code/poproofread/poproofread

Afterwards update the relavant databases with the following commands:
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/
update-desktop-database  ~/.local/share/applications/
