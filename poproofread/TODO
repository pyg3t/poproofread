TODO

* Make sure the core and fileio modules are reset after a failed read or change
  of save file
* Remove check for self.ppr.active in gui call backs and instead deactivate the
  controls when inactive
* Do something to the window title to indicate whether the current content has
  been saved
* Work with the jump_to_dialog. Pressing ok while in spinbutton does not
  register the change. Provided this can be changed, make the number selected
  when opening the dialog
* Check up on character sets on import from clipboard

Windows compatibility:
* Remove hard coding of settings location
* Change the parser to import (and save) windows style line endings
