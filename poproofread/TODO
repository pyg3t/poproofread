TODO

* Make sure the core and fileio modules are reset after a failed read or change
  of save file
* Remove check for self.ppr.active in gui call backs and instead deactivate the
  controls when inactive
* Do something to the window title to indicate whether the current content has
  been saved
* Work with the jump_to_dialog. Pressing ok while in spinbutton does not
  register the change. Provided this can be changed, make the number selected
  when opening the dialog
* Check up on character sets on import from clipboard

Windows compatibility:
* Remove hard coding of settings location
* Change the parser to import (and save) windows style line endings

NOTES:
Rewrite of open structure
core->open() calls fileio.read(), this method should change to return the file
content. Parsing of new content or json should be done i core.

fileio->read_new_from_text and fileio->__default_structure should be moved to
core

core->import_from_text calls fileio->read_new_from_text, see above

core->set_new_save_location calls fileio->check and set new file locations

=========================
Open call structure (existing project):

GUI->on_mnu_open()
 get filename from dialog
 GUI->open_file(filename)
  save en close existing file
  try:
   warnings = ppr.open(filename)
   show warnings
  except error
   show error

ppr->open(filename)
 ...
