TODO

* Make sure the core and fileio modules are reset after a failed read or change
  of save file
* Remove check for self.ppr.active in gui call backs and instead deactivate the
  controls when inactive
* Do something to the window title to indicate whether the current content has
  been saved
* Work with the jump_to_dialog. Pressing ok while in spinbutton does not
  register the change. Provided this can be changed, make the number selected
  when opening the dialog
* Check up on character sets on import from clipboard

Windows compatibility:
* Remove hard coding of settings location
* Change the parser to import (and save) windows style line endings

NOTES:
Open call structure (existing project):

GUI->on_mnu_open()
 get filename from dialog
 GUI->open_file(filename)
  save en close existing file
  try:
   warnings = ppr.open(filename)
   show warnings
  except error
   show error

ppr->open(filename)
 ...
