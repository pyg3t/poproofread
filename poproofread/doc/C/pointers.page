    <title>The <app>PoProofRead</app> files</title>
    <p>After opening a file and saving the ongoing work for the first time, two new files has now been created, in the same folder that the original file was placed in. The files are named like this:</p>
    <terms>
      <item>
	<title><file>example.podiff</file></title>
	<p>This is the file with the original content that needs proofreading. This file should only be opened when the work on this files content is started.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<title><file>example.podiff.ppr</file></title>
	<p>The is <app>PoProofRead</app>'s internal representation of the proofreading. It contains all the content of the original podiff, the comments and various information about current state of the proofreading. This is the file that should be opened for resuming previous work on a proofreading.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<title><file>example.podiff.ppr.out</file></title>
	<p>This file contains the output of the proofreading. It contains the podiff parts that has been commented on and their comments. It is ready to send back to the author of the podiff as is.</p>
