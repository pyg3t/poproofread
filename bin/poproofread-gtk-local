# This file is used as the main PoProofRead execution file instead of
# poproofread-gtk in cases where the program is run directly from the source
# code directory. The main difference is that in this case we need to manually
# add the poproofread code path to the python path

import sys
import os
# Get the directory two levels up from this file
PATH = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

# Check if we are indeed in source code mode before modifying the path
if os.path.split(PATH)[1] == 'poproofread':
    sys.path.append(PATH)

from poproofread import poproofread_gtk
